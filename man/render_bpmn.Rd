\arguments{
\item{bpmn}{A BPMN object as a list of data.frames for the BPMN elements and
an XML document for the XML-based interchange format for the BPMN process.}

\item{viewer.suppress}{Never display the widget within the RStudio Viewer
(useful for widgets that require a large amount of space for rendering).
Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{width}{Fixed width for widget (in css units). The default is NULL,
which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the widget's
container.}

\item{height}{Fixed height for widget (in css units). The default is NULL,
which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the widget's
container.}

\item{elementId}{Use an explicit element ID for the widget (rather than an
automatically generated one). Useful if you have other JavaScript that
needs to explicitly discover and interact with a specific widget instance.}

\item{xml_version_number}{The version of the XML standard used.}

\item{xml_encoding_declaration}{The character encoding used in the XML
declaration. \sQuote{UTF-8} is the default encoding used.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}
